Variants
=========
This document lists UniProtKB manually reviewed Natural Variants.
Where possible a full definition of the genomic change is provided.
This document also lists protein altering variants imported from the publicly
accessible variant resouces such as Ensembl Variation and ClinVar databases.
These variants are currently not available in the corresponding UniProtKB
entries.
The variants listed are the Ensembl Variation databases' set of 1000 Genomes
project (http://www.1000genomes.org/), The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC),
the National Cancer Institute public Cancer Genome Atlas (NCI-TCGA) variants,
Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations In Cancer
(COSMIC) v71, imported directly from COSMIC and via Ensembl Variation,  protein
altering variants (SO:0001583). COSMIC v71 variants are the last freely
available somatic variants from COSMIC before their licence change; therefore
the accuracy of the information provided for a COSMIC variant should be
verified with COSMIC.
The variant types listed currently include missense variants (SO:0001582), stop
lost (SO:0001578), stop gained (SO:0001587) and initiator codon variants
(SO:0001582). When available, phenotype/disease description(s) for a variant are
imported from Ensembl with an accompanying source for the phenotype/disease.

FORMAT NOTES
============
1. Mappings are made between UniProtKB canonical/isoform sequences and Ensembl
transcripts. More than one Ensembl transcript can be translated into the same
protein sequence, therefore more than one Ensembl transcript can be mapped to a
UniProtKB canonical or isoform sequence. For each UniProt accession the mapped
Ensembl transcripts are listed separately with one line for each Ensembl
transcript with equivalent information repeated.
2. In addition, a variant (eg rs1234567) can occur in more than one Ensembl
transcript, therefore each variant is described in a separate line for each
Ensembl transcript it occurs in, with equivalent information repeated.
3. Where a variant record has more than one phenotype or disease description,
each description is recorded in a separate line, with equivalent information
repeated. Note that some variants have multiple phenotype/disease descriptions
that might be essentially the same. UniProt is evaluating controlled
vocabularies for phenotypes/diseases that will be introduced in an updated
version of this file.

Definition of variant record fields:

1) Gene Name:
Main gene name as defined for the UniProtKB entry

2) AC:
UniProtKB accession for the entry

3)  Variant AA Change:
The change in amino acid sequence as a consequence of the variant. Using the
Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature
(http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/recs-prot.html), an amino acid change is defined
as the original amino acid, followed by the residue number, then by the
resulting amino acid as a consequence of the variant. The three letter acronyms
for the amino acids names are used. Eg p.Val123Ile.

4) Source Database (DB) Identifier (ID):
dbSNP identifier, eg rs1234567 or COSM12345

5) Consequence Type:
Sequence Ontology (SO) (http://www.sequenceontology.org) definition of the
variant consequence type.
Missense variant is defined by SO:0001583 - 'A sequence variant, that changes
one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the
length is preserved.'
Initiator codon variant is defined by SO:0001582 - 'A codon variant that changes
at least one base of the first codon of a transcript.'
Stop lost variant is defined by SO:0001578 - 'A sequence variant where at least
one base of the terminator codon (stop) is changed, resulting in an elongated
transcript. The resulting amino acid change is defined, the subsequent
elongation to the sequence is not stated.'
Stop gained variant is defined by SO:0001587 - 'A sequence variant whereby at
least one base of a codon is changed, resulting in a premature stop codon,
leading to a shortened transcript.'

6) Clinical Significance:
A comma separated list of values from the dbSNP controlled vocabulary describing
a predicted clinical significance of the variant
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/docs/rs_attributes.html).
eg pathogenic, untested.
A '-' (dash) means no value in Ensembl Variation.

7) Phenotype/Disease:
As imported from Ensembl Variation databases this text description defines a
phenotype or disease that has been associated with the variant. The source used
by Ensembl Variation for the phenotype/disease is given in field 8.
A '-' (dash) means no value in Ensembl Variation.

8) Phenotype/Disease Source:
A scientific publication (PubMed) or Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)
cross reference defining the associated phenotype/disease in field 7. 
A '-' (dash) means no value in Ensembl Variation.

9) Cytogenetic Band:
The cytogenetic band location of the variant allele.

10) Chromosome coordinate:
Chromosome and base pair (bp) coordinate eg 19:g.58864491G>A
which states the variant is on chromosome 19 at genomic (g) base pair
58864491 and the allele change is G>A

11) Ensembl gene ID:
Stable Ensembl gene identifier

12) Ensembl transcript ID:
Stable Ensembl transcript identifier

13) Ensembl translation ID:
Stable Ensembl translation identifier

14) Variant Evidence:
A comma separated list of variant databases that separately report the variant.
A '-' (dash) means no separate evidence for the variant available
