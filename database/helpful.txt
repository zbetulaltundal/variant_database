!!!
I believe this is related to PyVCF not compatible with setuptools used in newer Python (mine is Python 3.7.12), 
as mentioned in this issue: jamescasbon/PyVCF#332

Also, it seems that PyVCF only parses VCF format V4.0 and V4.1, whereas the standard right now is V4.2. 
The package does not seem to be maintained anymore. 
So it may be better to switch to a newer VCF parser.

github duplicate a repo ??? not working
